          The best and most recommended way to prevent the spread of germs and
          bacteria is to wash your hands. But in instances where you might not
          be near a bathroom or just want extra protection, hand sanitizers are
          the next best thing (or best additional thing) — especially as we're
          all trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19 . Considering that 80
          percent of all infections are transmitted by hands. Alcohol-based hand
          sanitizers, on the other hand, do kill germs on the skin — most germs,
          anyway. Hand sanitizer are best for killing germs withouth soap and
          water. Scientists suspect hand sanitizer does, however, kill the
          coronavirus.
